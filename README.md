Bash scripts and homework assignments 
## Bash Course IFT 383
One of my first major introductions to Bash was in the ASU course IFT 383. In this course we used Bash to solve some smaller problems and tasks, as well as create a few games. I almost immediately fell in love with Bash as it mixes my love for the Linux command line with scripting/programming logic concepts. 
### Layout 
This repo is broken down into different sections. I will include the larger assignments like the hangman game and the nginx log script as well as a few folders that include more simplistic scripts that were assigned during the Shell Scripting course. Most of these include basic introuctions of core concepts and I have tried to include notes in the script, or name them adaptly in order to demonstrate what they do.
